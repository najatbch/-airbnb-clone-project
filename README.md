# Airbnb Clone Project – Backend (StayBackend)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a backend-focused application designed to simulate a real-world booking platform like Airbnb.  
The goal is to **design, implement, and secure** a scalable backend system with modern tools and practices.  

### 🎯 Goals:
- Build a **scalable backend system** using Django.
- Design a **relational database** for users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments.
- Implement **secure APIs** for managing platform features.
- Automate deployment with **CI/CD pipelines**.
- Practice **team collaboration** with GitHub.

## 👥 Team Roles
- **Backend Developer**: Implements the application logic, REST/GraphQL APIs, and integrates database queries.  
- **Database Administrator (DBA)**: Designs, maintains, and optimizes the database schema (PostgreSQL/MySQL).  
- **DevOps Engineer**: Manages CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers, and deployment environments.  
- **Project Manager**: Oversees project progress, ensures deadlines are met, and facilitates collaboration.  
- **QA Engineer**: Tests API endpoints, verifies data integrity, and ensures feature reliability.

## 🛠 Technology Stack
- **Django** – Python web framework used to build RESTful/GraphQL APIs.  
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL** – Relational database for storing users, bookings, and transactions.  
- **GraphQL** – Provides flexible querying for frontend applications.  
- **Docker** – Containerization for consistent environment setup.  
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD automation for testing and deployment.  
- **NGINX/Gunicorn** – Web server & WSGI server for production deployment.

## 🗄 Database Design
Entities & relationships:

- **User** → (id, name, email, password_hash, role)  
- **Property** → (id, owner_id [FK User], title, description, price, location)  
- **Booking** → (id, user_id [FK User], property_id [FK Property], check_in, check_out, status)  
- **Review** → (id, user_id [FK User], property_id [FK Property], rating, comment)  
- **Payment** → (id, booking_id [FK Booking], amount, status, payment_method)  

### Relationships:
- A user can own multiple properties.  
- A property can have many bookings and reviews.  
- A booking belongs to one property and one user.  
- A payment is linked to a booking.

## 🔐 API Security
- **Authentication**: JWT-based login system to verify user identity.  
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (only property owners cans edit their listings).  
- **Data Validation**: Prevent SQL injection and invalid inputs.  
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect against brute force attacks.  
- **Secure Payments**: Encrypt sensitive data and enforce HTTPS.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** – Automated tests run on every push via GitHub Actions.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)** – Code is automatically deployed to staging/production.  
- **Tools**:  
  - GitHub Actions – workflow automation.  
  - Docker – build and deploy containers.  
  - NGINX – reverse proxy for serving APIs securely.
